Product:
-	Idea: From given course/degree, find prerequisites and when you can take them (some courses only offered in certain sems)
-	Interface: (TBC)
o	Grid (3x3)
o	Buttons for each course must complete over time
o	Click on button, blacks out unavailable on grid
o	Click on available ? puts course there
o	Next course only placed afterwards 
o	Alert if chosen course has prereq
o	
o	Reset button
o	Way to see if you stuff up
Problem:
-	Apps should be orientated for user friendliness and help enhance people (you should choose your destination not the app)
-	Students unsure of higher education pathway post high school, which continues as you continue degree
-	Uncertainty in pathway planning can cause lengthier degree/time could be allotted elsewhere
Target Market/Market Size/Opportunity
-	students (uni) (have developed goal)
-	students (highschool) (unsure/have goal)
-	uni staff (required teaching components)
-	have stats for uni kids/staff in 2017 (UNSW annual report) and hs students 2017 (ABS)
Need/Context:
-	On market (competitive) apps show where you can go from here ? they choose your destination
-	Others (majority) apps focus on immediate (study, revision, timetable, assignments); no regard for future
o	Lack of planning for future courses/envisioning where you want to be
-	Most relevant app: UNSW pathways 
o	only shows a directed graph in the forwards direction
o	doesn?t cater to people thinking about a goal course
?	have to be in it (have to invest before you can see a path)
o	will promote farther thinking and foresight in youth
Solution/Unique selling points:
-	App promotes forward thinking, gives path backwards
-	long term traction; goals will/can change
-	expansion:
Platforms to market/Marketing Strategy
